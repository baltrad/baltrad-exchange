baltrad-exchange is like the name says, software for exchanging data and has been developed
within the BALTRAD partnership.

It is the second generation engine and is intended to replace the publisher/subscriber part in baltrad-dex
that was developed within the BALTRAD and BALTRAD+ projects.

The publication/subscription mechanisms has been vastly improved with the possibility to use different protocols
for distributing files in various ways. Files can be identified by using metadata filters. Active polling mechanisms
has been added when files has to be fetched from remote servers. The exchange can be run without an external
database (instead a local sqlite database is used for lookups).
