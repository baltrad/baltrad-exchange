About
-----
Baltrad Exchange, working name baltrad-exchange, is part of the BALTRAD project providing functionality for exchanging ODIM-H5 files with
other nodes. The first version of the software that provided this is called baltrad-dex. This second generation engine will replace the
publisher/subscriber parts within baltrad-dex that was developed within the BALTRAD and BALTRAD+ projects.

The publication/subscription mechanisms has been improved with the possibility to use different protocols
for distributing files in various ways. Files can be identified by using metadata filters. Active polling mechanisms
has been added when files has to be fetched from remote servers. The exchange can be run without an external
database (instead a local sqlite database is used for source lookups) which makes installation and configuration easier.

The software is written in python and is using parts of the baltrad-db APIs. If the files should be stored within the
baltrad-db, that is possible as well and the metadata matched will be the one that baltrad-db has returned.
